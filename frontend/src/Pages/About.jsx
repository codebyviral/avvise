                AVVISE began with a simple yet profound vision: to bridge the
                gap between traditional educational practices and the vast
                potential of modern technology. Founded by Viral Vaghela, a
                dedicated Fullstack developer, the journey started from a shared
                frustration among educators: the time-consuming and often
                daunting task of grading. Inspired by the belief that technology
                could revolutionize education, Viral set out to design a grading
                app that would simplify this process. Our journey has been one
                of constant learning, adapting, and improving based on the needs
                of educators and students around the globe.

                At the heart of AVVISE lies our commitment to transforming the
                educational landscape. Our primary purpose is to provide

                process, allowing them to save precious time while grading
                multiple-choice questions (MCQs). By automating evaluations, we

                with their students. Our overarching goal is to make grading
                accurate, efficient, and hassle-free, ensuring that both
                educators and students can focus on what truly mattersâ€”learning.
